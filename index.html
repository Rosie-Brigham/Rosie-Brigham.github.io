                Rosie graduated from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University College London (UCL)</a> in 2013 with a <em>BA</em> degree in 
                <em>History of Art with Material Studies</em>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2016, she was awarded the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/professor-sir-malcolm-grant-postgraduate-scholarship" target="_blank">Professor Malcolm Grant Scholarship</a> 
                and returned to UCL to pursue a <em>Master of Research (MRes) 
                in Heritage Science</em>. Here, she was able to combine her expertise in software and web development, with her passion for 
                history and conservation. During this period she developed the first iteration of 
                <a href="https://www.monumentmonitor.co.uk/" target="_blank">Monument Monitor</a> in partnership with 
                <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/about-us/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Historic Environment Scotland</a>, a platform that 
                utilises vistor photographs to aid heritage sites conservation monitoring. 
                This research has been published in the prestigious journal 
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201801743" target="_blank">Angewadte Chemie (impact factor 15.3)</a>.

              <p>
                This work led to Rosie pursuing a <em>PhD in Citizen Science, Heritage Science and Software Engineering</em>, completed in September 
                2021. The main product of this research, an advanced <a href="mm">AI-Driven Monument Monitor</a>, is described in full below.

            After leaving university, Rosie joined the first cohort of <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">CodeFirst: Girls</a>, a pioneering organization established by 
            <a href="https://www.joinef.com/people/alice-bentinck/" target="_blank">Alice Bentinck</a> and <a href="https://www.matthewclifford.com/" target="_blank">Matt Clifford</a> 
            (founders of <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">Entreprenuer First</a>), where she was trained in <em>Agile</em> and <em>web development</em>. 
            She then joined <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/" target="_blank">Funding Circle</a> as a technical intern training in <em>Rails, CSS, Javascript and HTML</em>.

            Rosie subsequently joined <a href="https://www.woolandthegang.com" target="_blank">Wool and the Gang</a> in 2014 as a full stack web developer. As well as honing her knitting skills, 
            she managed numerous successful projects, quickly learning different tool and technologies. Simultaneously, Rosie transitioned
             from <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">CodeFirst: Girls</a> alumni to educator, becoming a <em>lead facilitator and teacher</em> 
             to deliver evening classes teaching women the basics of 
             web development. These eight-week practical courses took students through the fundamentals of <em>HTML, CSS & JS</em> alongside responsive
              design, <em>Git & GitHub, Agile</em> and best programming practices. At this point she also assisted <a href="https://twitter.com/riklomas" target="_blank">Rik Lomas</a> in delivering the first in 
              person ‘Learn to Code’ course which subsequently developed into <a href="https://www.superhi.com" target="_blank">SuperHi</a>, an innovative technical education platform.

            In January 2016 she purchased a one-way ticket to New Zealand and travelled across the country with her laptop, earning bread and board 
            as a <em>freelance web developer</em> for small businesses lacking the necessary internal capability. During this time, Rosie travelled to 
            Australia to work as a <em>workshop facilitator</em> for <a href="https://decoded.com/" target="_blank">Decoded</a>. After several months she settled 
            in Wellington, NZ and joined <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/" target="_blank">Enspiral Dev Academy </a>as a <em>Lead Facilitator</em>, where she was 
            responsible for delivering content and mentoring students the art of  programming in a 12 week intensive bootcamp. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Rosie was awarded a scholarship by UCL and left New Zealand to pursue an <em>MRes in Heritage Science</em>. Upon completion, she joined the development team at
            <a href="https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Soho House</a>  to enhance her skills as a <em>ruby engineer</em>. 
            Successful projects included the creation of custom APIs for membership
            processing, and updating and maintaining 56 legacy sites, including a full GDPR compliance rollout. Rosie continued working with 
            <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">CodeFirst: Girls</a> to deliver their flagship evening classes and led the development of new, 
            interactive curriculum topics that aligned with the latest software engineering practices.

          In September 2017, Rosie began a <em>PhD</em> at UCL to develop an <em>AI-driven citizen science platform</em>, building on the original version of 
          <a href="#mm">Monument Monitor</a>. Throughout her PhD research Rosie freelanced on a number of projects, 
          including the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jojo38/voices-through-time-the-story-of-care" target="_blank">Voices Through Time</a> and the

            Throughout her career Rosie has been a <em>passionate advocate for getting more women into technical positions</em>. Alongside her work 
            with <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">CodeFirst: Girls</a> she is an active mentor, 
            helping women advance their career through technical instruction and support.  
            Over the years she has <em>spoken at a variety of events</em> sharing her experience to encourage more women into coding positions 
            including the CodeFirst: Girls Annual Conference 2015, Stack Overflow Developers meetup, and the Digital Shoreditch Festival 2015
             and London Techmakers, among others.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her PhD she developed numerous short instructor-led courses to assist researchers with their technical skills including 
            "Introduction to github", "Github for Researchers" and "Creating a website for your PhD project". 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019 she developed and ran the first <a href="https://nationalheritagescienceforum.wordpress.com/2019/05/30/how-to-hack-heritage-science/" target="_blank">Heritage Science Hackathon</a>, 
            designed to <em>bring together experienced technologists with small heritage institutions</em> that lacked technical capacity within their 
            volunteer workforce. The event was a great 
            success and was awarded £10,000 of follow-on impact funding from EPSRC.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her PhD she supervised several MSC students in field of <em>Citizen Science, Machine Learning and Machine Vision</em> and helped 
            develop a pioneering an MSC module on 
            <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/crowd-sourced-and-citizen-data-for-cultural-heritage-BENV0114" target="_blank">Citizen Science in Heritage</a>. 
            She has <em>lectured</em> on topics of citizen science, data science and machine vision.
