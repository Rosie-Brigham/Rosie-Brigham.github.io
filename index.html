          Rosie graduated from University College London (UCL) in 2013 with a <em>BA</em> degree in <em>History of Art with Material Studies</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, she was awarded the Professor Malcolm Grant Scholarship and returned to UCL to pursue a <em>Master of Research (MRes) 
            in Heritage Science</em>. Here, she was able to combine her expertise in software and web development, with her passion for 
          history and conservation. During this period she developed the first iteration of Monument Monitor in partnership with 
          Historic Environment Scotland, a platform that utilised vistor photographs to aid heritage sites conservation monitoring. 
          This research has been published in the prestigious journal Angewadte Chemie (impact factor 15.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          This work led to Rosie pursuing a <em>PhD in Citizen Science, Heritage Science and Software Engineering</em>, completed in September 
          2021. The main product of this research, an advanced AI-Driven Monument Monitor, is described in full below.

        </section>

        <p>
          After leaving university, Rosie joined the first cohort of CodeFirst: Girls, a pioneering organization established by 
          Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford (founders of Entreprenuer First), where she was trained in <em>Agile</em> and <em>web development</em>. 
          She then joined Funding Circle as a technical intern training in <em>Rails, CSS, Javascript and HTML</em>. 
        </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="item5">
        <p>
          Rosie subsequently joined Wool and the Gang in 2014 as a full stack web developer. As well as honing her knitting skills, 
          she managed numerous successful projects, quickly learning different tool and technologies. Simultaneously, Rosie transitioned
           from CodeFirst: Girls alumni to educator, becoming a <em>lead facilitator and teacher</em> to deliver evening classes teaching women the basics of 
           web development. These eight-week practical courses took students through the fundamentals of <em>HTML, CSS & JS</em> alongside responsive
            design, <em>Git & GitHub, Agile</em> and best programming practices. At this point she also assisted Rik Lomas in delivering the first in 
            person ‘Learn to Code’ course which subsequently developed into SuperHi, an innovative technical education platform.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="item6">
        <p>
          In January 2016 she purchased a one-way ticket to New Zealand and travelled across the country with her laptop, earning bread and board 
          as a <em>freelance web developer</em> for small businesses lacking the necessary internal capability. During this time, Rosie travelled to 
          Australia to work as a <em>workshop facilitator</em> for Decoded in their popular ‘Code in a Day’ workshops. After several months she settled 
          in Wellington, NZ and joined Enspiral Dev Academy as a <em>Lead Facilitator</em>, where she was responsible for delivering content and mentoring 
          students the art of  programming in a 12 week intensive bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rosie was awarded a scholarship by UCL and left New Zealand to pursue an <em>MRes in Heritage Science</em>. Upon completion, she joined Soho 
          House to enhance her skills as a <em>ruby engineer</em>. Successful projects included the creation of custom APIs for membership
           processing, and updating and maintaining 56 legacy sites, including a full GDPR compliance rollout. Rosie continued working with 
           CodeFirst: Girls to deliver their flagship evening classes and led the development of new, interactive curriculum topics that aligned 
           with the latest software engineering practices.

        In September 2017, Rosie began a <em>PhD</em> at UCL to develop an <em>AI-driven citizen science platform</em>, building on the original version of 
        Monument Monitor. Throughout her PhD research Rosie freelanced on a number of projects, including the Voices Through Time and the 
        spin-off Dinosaur Monitor project.

          Monument Monitor is a ground-breaking research project founded which utilises visitors’ photographs of heritage sites in their 
          care and conservation. <em>Founded by Rosie in 2018</em>, the project utilises <em>machine learning</em> and <em>environmental modelling</em> at 
          participating heritage sites to help predict how they will be affected by the changing climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside <em>developing the project, website and branding</em> Rosie also <em>developed the software, machine learning models</em> and the 
          <em>research methodology</em> alongside <em>managing</em> a group of 20+ different <em>stakeholders</em> across the two partnering organisations, Historic 
          Environment Scotland and The Institute for Sustainable Heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rosie has presented the findings of this research at a variety of conferences including DigiDoc, ICC, AHRCH and ICOMOS 2020.

          Throughout her career Rosie has been a <em>passionate advocate for getting more women into technical positions</em>. Alongside her work 
          with CodeFirst Girls she is an active mentor, helping women advance their career through technical instruction and support.  
          Over the years she has <em>spoken at a variety of events</em> sharing her experience to encourage more women into coding positions 
          including the CodeFirst: Girls Annual Conference 2015, Stack Overflow Developers meetup, and the Digital Shoreditch Festival 2015
           and London Techmakers, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          During her PhD she developed numerous short instructor-led courses to assist researchers with their technical skills including 
          ‘Introduction to github’, ‘Github for Researchers’ and ‘Creating a website for your PhD project’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 she developed and ran the first Heritage Science Hackathon’, designed to <em>bring together experienced technologists 
            with small heritage institutions</em> that lacked technical capacity within their volunteer workforce. The event was a great 
          success and was awarded £10,000 of follow-on impact funding from EPSRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          During her PhD she supervised several MSC students in field of <em>Citizen Science, Machine Learning and Machine Vision</em> and helped 
          develop a pioneering an MSC module on Citizen Science in Heritage. She has <em>lectured</em> on topics of citizen science, data science 
          and machine vision.
