          Rosie graduated from University College London (UCL) in 2013 with a BA degree in History of Art with Material Studies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, she was awarded the Professor Malcolm Grant Scholarship and returned to UCL to pursue a Master of Research (MRes) 
          in Heritage Science. Here, she was able to combine her expertise in software and web development, with her passion for 
          history and conservation. During this period she developed the first iteration of Monument Monitor in partnership with 
          Historic Environment Scotland, a platform that utilised vistor photographs to aid heritage sites conservation monitoring. 
          This research has been published in the prestigious journal Angewadte Chemie (impact factor 15.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          This work led to Rosie pursuing a PhD in Citizen Science, Heritage Science and Software Engineering, completed in September 
          2021. The main product of this research, an advanced AI-Driven Monument Monitor, is described in full below.
