          Rosie graduated from University College London (UCL) in 2013 with a BA degree in History of Art with Material Studies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, she was awarded the Professor Malcolm Grant Scholarship and returned to UCL to pursue a Master of Research (MRes) 
          in Heritage Science. Here, she was able to combine her expertise in software and web development, with her passion for 
          history and conservation. During this period she developed the first iteration of Monument Monitor in partnership with 
          Historic Environment Scotland, a platform that utilised vistor photographs to aid heritage sites conservation monitoring. 
          This research has been published in the prestigious journal Angewadte Chemie (impact factor 15.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          This work led to Rosie pursuing a PhD in Citizen Science, Heritage Science and Software Engineering, completed in September 
          2021. The main product of this research, an advanced AI-Driven Monument Monitor, is described in full below.

        <p>
          After leaving university, Rosie joined the first cohort of CodeFirst: Girls, a pioneering organization established by 
          Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford (founders of Entreprenuer First), where she was trained in Agile and web development. 
          She then joined Funding Circle as a technical intern training in Rails, CSS, Javascript and HTML.

          Rosie subsequently joined Wool and the Gang in 2014 as a full stack web developer. As well as honing her knitting skills, 
          she managed numerous successful projects, quickly learning different tool and technologies. Simultaneously, Rosie transitioned
           from CodeFirst: Girls alumni to educator, becoming a lead facilitator to deliver evening classes teaching women the basics of 
           web development. These eight-week practical courses took students through the fundamentals of HTML, CSS & JS alongside responsive
            design, Git & GitHub, Agile and best programming practices. At this point she also assisted Rik Lomas in delivering the first in 
            person ‘Learn to Code’ course which subsequently developed into SuperHi, an innovative technical education platform.

          In January 2016 she purchased a one-way ticket to New Zealand and travelled across the country with her laptop, earning bread and board 
          as a freelance web developer for small businesses lacking the necessary internal capability. During this time, Rosie travelled to 
          Australia to work as a workshop facilitator for Decoded in their popular ‘Code in a Day’ workshops. After several months she settled 
          in Wellington, NZ and joined Enspiral Dev Academy as a Lead Facilitator, where she was responsible for delivering content and mentoring 
          students the art of  programming in a 12 week intensive bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rosie was awarded a scholarship by UCL and left New Zealand to pursue an MRes in Heritage Science. Upon completion, she joined Soho 
          House to enhance her skills as a backend ruby engineer. Successful projects included the creation of custom APIs for membership
           processing, and updating and maintaining 56 legacy sites, including a full GDPR compliance rollout. Rosie continued working with 
           CodeFirst: Girls to deliver their flagship evening classes and led the development of new, interactive curriculum topics that aligned 
           with the latest software engineering practices.
